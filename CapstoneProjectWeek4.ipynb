Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.\n\nThis submission will eventually become your Introduction/Business Problem section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Introduction/Business Problem section only for now) to your Github repository and submit a link to it.\n\nFor this week, you will required to submit the following:\n\n-A description of the problem and a discussion of the background. (15 marks)\n\n-A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem. (15 marks)"
